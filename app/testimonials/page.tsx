          questions and keeping his appointments with us. He was friendly, made
          good suggestions and always returned our phone calls. We also felt
          lucky that Junior was the foreman for this project. He is a skilled
          worker who helped us to make decisions that improved the final look of
          our house. The remainder of the workers, Brian, Scott and others who
          helped, were also very hard workers. We appreciate their friendliness
          and good manners. They seemed to enjoy their work while doing it in a
          professional way. We would also like to thank you. We felt you treated
          us fairly and honestly throughout the project. Again, thanks for a
          great job!”

          Terrific job on our barn roof...

          “The Buhr Construction team did a terrific job on our barn roof. The
          project was a roof replacement on a 150-year-old barn. The roof was
          very high and the tear off was a dirty job. They conscientiously
          looked for and repaired and/or replaced the deteriorated and rotted
          sections of the old roof before proceeding with the new roof.” “The
          team shared a strong work ethic and took pride in their work. The
          quality of their craftsmanship was outstanding, and even the cleanup
          was well done. Andy and Toby were good communicators during the
          project to ensure expectations were met or exceeded. I am very please
          with the new roof. Thanks again to the team for a job well done!””
